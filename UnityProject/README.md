# UnityProject

This folder is a **placeholder Unity project root**.

Open it in Unity Hub (Unity 6 / 6000 LTS target). Unity will generate additional folders/files (Library, Temp, etc.) which are excluded by the repo `.gitignore`.

Documentation lives at the repo root (`README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and `docs/`).
