# Gameplay pillars

## 1) City simulation
- District-based or grid/chunk world.
- Core systems: zoning, infrastructure, utilities, logistics.
- The city should develop **district identity** based on choices (policy + investment + faction pressure).

## 2) Governance & morality (edict system)
A branching edict/policy layer that:
- Changes simulation parameters (production, safety, morale, surveillance, etc.).
- Leaves visible marks on the city (architecture add-ons, signage, lighting, enforcement presence).

Edict categories (seed list):
- Civic
- Corporate
- Security
- Underground

## 3) Expeditions (“Badlands”)
An external mission layer inspired by *Frostpunk*:
- Send teams to POIs outside the perimeter.
- Return with resources, tech, narrative cards, and persistent modifiers.
- Mission statuses are a key UI beat (terminal-style tracking).

## 4) Modes
- Scenario/campaign (authored constraints + narrative)
- Endless sandbox
- Future possibility: async/co-op (TBD)
