# Factions (initial concepts)

These are **seed concepts** extracted from the surviving design notes and expanded into a working baseline.

## The Directorate
**Role:** corporate governance + security apparatus.

**Aesthetic:** black/chrome, amber warning accents, stamped IDs, rigid grids.

**Narrative hook:** order, quotas, “the city must survive.”

**System pressure they apply:** efficiency, surveillance, enforcement, emergency powers.

## The Syndics
**Role:** street-level collectivists / shadow organizers.

**Aesthetic:** magenta accents, repurposed panels, hand-applied glyphs, hacked signage.

**Narrative hook:** freedom, mutual aid, anti-surveillance.

**System pressure they apply:** sabotage vs. resilience, black-market logistics, soft power through communities.

## The Archivists
**Role:** preservationists / technomonks; memory as infrastructure.

**Aesthetic:** muted teal, cataloguing grids, archival labeling, “specimen” UI patterns.

**Narrative hook:** knowledge preserves—but **knowledge has a cost**.

**System pressure they apply:** research acceleration, dangerous tech unlocks, ethical tradeoffs.

## The Ordinators
**Role:** enforcement zealots with an AI/cult flavor.

**Aesthetic:** sterile whites, LED halos, synthetic voices, ritualized warnings.

**Narrative hook:** purity through compliance; the machine as judge.

**System pressure they apply:** crackdowns, predictive policing, stability at the expense of humanity.
